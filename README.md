Please note: The code was made in CLION and may not work on other IDEs.
This program was made for a project for a University course, meant to demonstrate knowledge of C++ and OOP.
When playing the game, the player will go through tooms, which have randomly generated enemies and items. One such item, a key, is needed to travel to the next floor of the dungeon. 
When the player enters a room with an enemy, they will enter combat. Combat is turn based, with the enemy taking an action and the player responding, until one side or the other runs out of health. The enemy can feint, however they run on static and predictable patterns which the player can learn.
The results of a turn depend on what the player and enemy do. Find within the repository "Combat_Table.png", to see what the results of a combat turn will be. Note: "Damage" refers to damage to the player.

Please find also a Word document with more detailed explaination of the code, which was produced as part of the project specification.
